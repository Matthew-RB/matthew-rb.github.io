        <p>
            For a intermediate coaster. family members should try roller coasters that would have some high speeds with not so much drops and stops.
            This would have the person get used to a little more speed on coasters with little drops to get used to it as well. 
            The intermediate coasters would be about any coaster that is not a top thrill ride.
