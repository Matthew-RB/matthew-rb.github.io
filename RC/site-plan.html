        The audience may want to read about the fun reviews that people say about the roller coaster and about the bad reviews so that they know 
        what they are going to expect when they go to the ride and have a pre-expectation of the ride that it will be good or bad. 
        People can also read about the description of the ride that the original ride has. If people want to search about the theme park roller 
        coasters like Disney Land, they can research that, and the website will also inform them that the ride is in Disney Land or World,
        and they need to have tickets to the theme park before they can ride the Roller Coaster. It will also have the height limit to ride the 
        ride and any information that the roller coaster may give out such as sudden drops or that you need to not have any loose items in your 
        pockets.
